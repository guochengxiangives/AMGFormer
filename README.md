**Abstract——**
Multimodal MRI is essential for brain tumor segmentation, yet missing modalities in clinical practice cause existing methods to suffer from severe instability, exhibiting >40$ performance variance across different modality combinations, rendering them clinically unreliable. We propose AMGTransformer, achieving unprecedented stability through three synergistic modules addressing fundamental architectural flaws: (1) Quadra-Integrating Bridge (QIB) enabling spatially adaptive fusion that maintains consistent predictions regardless of available modalities, (2) Multi-Granularity Attention Organizer (MGAO) focusing on pathological regions to reduce sensitivity to background variations, and (3) Modality Quality-Aware Enhancement (MQAE) preventing error propagation from corrupted sequences. On BraTS 2018, our method achieves 89.33\% WT, 82.70% TC, and 67.23% ET Dice scores with <1% variance across 15 modality combinations, solving the stability crisis. Single-modality ET segmentation shows 40-81% improvements over state-of-the-art methods on BraTS 2018/2020 with 0.5-0.8% variance. The method generalizes to BraTS 2020/2021, achieving up to 92.44% WT, 89.91% TC, and 84.57% ET scores. With 1.2s inference, the model enables reliable clinical deployment.
